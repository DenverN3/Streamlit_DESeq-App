# Streamlit_DESeq-App
A repository for making a streamlit app for displaying of differential expression results
I made this repo as part of an iterative process of making a differential expression application where you can upload your data and specify the conditions for your experimental design and run differential expression analysis. Please feel free to suggest more features to add especially on the plotting and graphical side of things. I will be updating periodically to enable the integration of more features.
